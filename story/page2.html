                Bored, with nothing else to do, you decide to feed them some bread. The ducks flap their wings from excitement, as bread has fallen from the heavens. They consume their bounty, and stare up at their provider. You feel a sense of fulfillment in your heart, as now something actually appreciates what you do.
