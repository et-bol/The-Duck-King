                Bored out of your mind and with nothing better to do, you decide to feed them some bread. The ducks flap their wings from excitement, as bread falls from the heavens. They consume the crumbs and stare up at their godly provider. You feel a sense of fulfillment in your heart, as now something actually appreciates what you do.
