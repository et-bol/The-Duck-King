                Days go by as you continue to feed your new friends, and the flock of ducks that gather below your balcony every morning continues to grow. You love your new friends, as they help to fill the dark hole in your heart left after everyone who you loved abandoned you. Ducks won't leave you. Ducks can't break your heart, unlike your ex.
